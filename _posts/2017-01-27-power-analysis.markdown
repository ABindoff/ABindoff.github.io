title: Consulting a statistician for an a-priori power analysis
layout: post
---

These are some short, general guidelines for information that it is helpful to provide your friendly/cranky (delete as appropriate) statistician when you are asking for an a-priori power analysis:

1. *be very specific about your aims and hypotheses:* assume that the statistician doesn't know anything about your work or your planned experiment. If they have to work too hard to understand it, (a) so will the funding body or ethics committee so this is a good opportunity to hone your pitch, (b) they will have to invest too much time trying to figure out what you're trying to do and this isn't a good use of their time, (c) they might misunderstand what you are trying to achieve and give you bad advice.

2. *your statistician needs to be able to estimate an effect size:*  don't get too hung up on how they will do this (that's their job), and you don't need to calculate *d*, or *f^2*, or other statistics for them - but you will need to provide supporting literature or data from pilot studies that are somewhat comparable to the study that you are proposing. 

3. *be prepared to be told that your experiment is under-powered:*  this isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's a good reason to consult your friendly statistician early in case you need to reconsider your measures or the design of your experiment.
