If you need an introduction to Linear Mixed Effects models, a new R package 'squid' has a handy tutorial that allows you to get a feel for what they really do through exploration and simulation.

[squid package on cran](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/squid/squid.pdf "squid package")

For those of you I've sent here who are not acquainted with R or R Studio, run the following in R:

`install.packages("squid")`

`library(squid)`

`squidApp()`

A new browser window will open with the interactive tutorial.
